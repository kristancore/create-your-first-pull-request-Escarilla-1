Exercise 01: GIT
Submitted on February 5, 2025 

My expectations for this course laboratory revolves around
the hows of web programming and its application. Though there's a possibility
of the concepts being overwhelming I'm sure I'll enjoy absorbing the new
knowledge since this is what I am interested in with the study of computer science.
By the end of the course I expect that I am fully capable of creating my own web pages
and personal projects related to what is to be taught here.
